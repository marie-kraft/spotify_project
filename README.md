# spotify_project
Repository for my Computational Social Science project including Spotify API

To get your personal access to Spotify API follow the instructions on: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started

After that run introduce_to_spotify.R and Data.R to produce songs.RData, songs_and_attributes.RData and complete.RData for yourself
